# Assembly-line-game
Assembly line game developed using Java inside processing 

This was my work from my first programming project at university. The game starts off with you building a basic phone as you correctly make more phones more parts will unlock increasing the value of your phone if you make a phone incorrectly you will lose a life once all three lives are lost the score is checked against a high scores file and if higher than any of the other scores it will adjust all scores to fit the new score on the leaderboard

Once the game hits level 2 fire will start to appear in the game if your mouse goes over the fire the game immediately ends and all remaining lives are therefore lost.

In the main game when items are locked they can't be used when they reach the end of the conveyor belt it adds the value of the phone to the score and if incomplete the player will lose a life if all 3 are lost it's game over ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cca4bd32-3451-4d97-a13c-913425a6cc25)

As items become unlocked they begin to be not required parts but over time will become required![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313684bd-eb09-4c8a-9a24-61cc045a6951)

Fire appears from level 2![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b4c6e3c-6df5-437e-ac5b-0093cac3835d)

The game-over screen shows the score and instructs the user to press the button to go back to the main menu ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07da1cd9-414c-4856-a235-06f671e90ace)
